# To finish AsyncMethodController

- TestCall.call (at least needs a test still)
- verify()
- passing `ctx` to the controller to trigger change detection
- write docs
- test that it's exposed in the public API
- test all the typing
- scour the branch for outstanding TODO comments
- get `nth()` into `micro-dash`

---

- landing page to link to all API docs
- coveralls
  - help may be here, to combine multiple coverage runs into one report: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/11268
- Watch for when typedoc can support that "lib" mode that would eliminate the need for @hidden
