 * Use to migrate "versioned objects" from an old version to the latest. This is useful e.g. when keeping state in `Persistence`, and you release a new version of your app that changes its format.

 * For example, say your app persists an object with the shape `{ _version: 3, key_1: string }`. You change your code to remove the underscore from `key_1`, so you want to migrate data on users' machines accordingly. Bump your version to 4 and use `MigrationManager` like this:
 *
 * ```ts
 * interface MyData extends VersionedObject {
 *   _version: number;
 *   key1: string;
 * }
 *
 * // simulate old data in the previous format
 * const persistence = new Persistence<MyData>('my key');
 * persistence.put({ _version: 3, key_1: 'my string' } as any);
 *
 * const migrater = new MigrationManager<MyData>();
 * migrater.registerMigration(3, (oldObject: any) => {
 *   return { _version: 4, key1: oldObject.key_1 };
 * });
 *
 * const defaultData = { _version: 4, key1: 'default value' };
 * migrater.run(persistence, defaultData);
 * // ^ returns { _version: 4, key1: 'my string' }
 *
 * persistence.clear();
 * migrater.run(persistence, defaultData);
 * // ^ returns defaultData
